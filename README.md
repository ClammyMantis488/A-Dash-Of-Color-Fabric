# A Dash Of Color
Basically a mod that adds random stuff I want colored.
![All the colored wood I've added so far](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25406353/75845735-e52ea500-5d8e-11ea-9298-b9f4ab1a41eb.png)
## Issues
> Please contribute issues and or pull requests. I am extremely amateur as in I'm copying how other mods do it to learn. Big thanks goes to Brandcraft as it's pretty much structured exactly like his mods.



The default texturepack has no textures yet, and the wood doesn't burn. Also buttons aren't affected by axe tiers for some reason?
