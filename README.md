# A Dash Of Color
Basically a mod that adds random stuff I want colored.
![All the colored wood I've added so far](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25406353/75845735-e52ea500-5d8e-11ea-9298-b9f4ab1a41eb.png)
## Issues

The default texturepack has no textures yet, and the wood doesn't burn. Also buttons aren't affected by axe tiers for some reason?
